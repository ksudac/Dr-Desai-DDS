<h3 id="fillings">Fillings</h3>
<p>To treat a cavity, the decayed portion of the tooth will be removed and then the area on the tooth where the decayed material was removed will be "filled".
Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken teeth and teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding). There
are three common types of filling material.</p>
<ul class="service-list">
<li>White (Composite) Fillings are ideal for fixing small to medium sized cavities. They are good for people who prefer that their fillings look more natural. </li>
<li>Silver (Amalgam) Fillings are very durable and therefore are often the best choice for large cavities or those that occur in the back teeth where a lot of force is needed to chew.
One disadvantage of amalgam is that these types of fillings are not natural looking, especially when the filling is near the front of the mouth.</li>
<li>Gold Fillings (Inlays) are usually considered the most durable, but also the most costly. Another disadvantage is that gold fillings are not natural looking.</li>
</ul>

    
<h3 id="root-canals">Root Canals</h3>
<p>Root canal treatment is necessary when the pulp (soft tissue inside your teeth containing blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue) becomes
inflamed or diseased. During root canal treatment, the diseased pulp is removed. The pulp chamber and root canal(s) of the tooth are then
cleaned and sealed. Most patients who have root canal experience little or no discomfort or pain, and enjoy a restored tooth
that can last almost as long as its healthy original.</p>


<h3 id="extractions">Extractions</h3>
<p>Extractions are performed on a case by case basis for several reasons including tooth fracture, loose baby teeth, wisdom teeth, teeth with severe decay,
and in some cases for orthodontic treatment.</p>

<h3 id="missing">Missing Tooth Replacement</h3>
<ul class="service-list">
<li>Implants - Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth. They may be used to replace a single missing tooth or multiple missing teeth.
 During the procedure, a titanium post is inserted under the gums/within the jaw bone. This implant functions as a tooth root. Soon after, it is
 used to hold a single crown, multiple crowns, or even snap fitting to a denture.</li>
<li>Bridges -  A bridge replaces missing teeth with artificial teeth and literally “bridges” the gap where one or more teeth used to be. The bridge is attached to surrounding teeth for support.</li>
<li>Partial & Full Dentures - Dentures are removable appliances that can replace multiple missing teeth and help restore your smile. Dentures do not function exactly like natural
teeth do, but with time and patience one can learn to use them properly. If you’ve lost several or maybe all of your natural teeth, then replacing missing teeth will benefit your
appearance and your health. That's becauseThat’s because dentures make it easier to eat and speak better than you could without teeth—things that people often take for granted.</li>

        <ul class="white-list">
        <li>Zoom In-Office Whitening - Zoom combines a hydrogen peroxide gel combined with a focused UV light. Once the gel is applied to the teeth, the Zoom lamp accelerates
	the bleaching process (In just about an hour's time vs. 7-9 days worth of home bleaching.). As the hydrogen peroxide is broken down, oxygen enters the tooth enamel
	to bleach the stained substances, leaving the structure of the tooth unharmed and whiter.</li>
        <li>Custom at Home Whitening Trays - Peroxide gel is placed into custom-made dental trays to bleach the tooth enamel. Usually is done for 30 minutes per day... for 7-9 days in row.</li>
        <li>Every patient doing either method of dental bleaching with us gets the custom trays included, to keep for future touch-ups.</li>

        <h3 id="veneers">Cosmetic Bonded Veneers</h3>
        <p>Veneers are thin, custom-made 'shells' lab crafted of tooth-colored ceramics, designed to cover the entire front side of teeth. After being permanently bonded
	onto the teeth, they are very strong. Veneers can be an option for correcting severely discolored, fractured, decayed, or even crooked teeth in some cases.</p>

        <h3 id="invisalign">InvisAlign Orthodontics</h3>
        <p>InvisAlign is a great option to correct misaligned teeth. It uses a series of clear removable aligners that move your teeth.
        The aligners are changed every 2 weeks until your teeth have moved to the final position. Comfortable and practically unnoticeable
	while wearing, these aligners are also removable so you can eat, drink, brush, and floss as usual. Then just clean your teeth and
	put them back on. So many cases are now being with InvisAlign, instead of metal braces...for teens and adults alike.</p>

        <p>Bonding uses natural tooth shade composite filling material to reshape or fix a chipped tooth to provide a more esthetic result.
	It usually conserves natural structure and in some cases it is a great short term option to veneers.</p>

<h3 id="oral-exam">Comprehensive Oral Exam</h3>
<p>During the comprehensive oral exam we survey the mouth as a whole (visually & with periodic xrays) and recommend treatment options if needed. We also
perform a simple oral cancer screening. And of course, we like to review oral hygiene and make recommendations where needed.</p>
<ul class="service-list">
    <li id="cleanings">Regular Cleanings - We will remove plaque (bacteria/food debris film) and calculus (tartar) to leave slick/clean teeth plus promote
    healthy gums. Usually, this will remove superficial stains from coffee, tea and smoking. (In cases of more severe gum conditions... we also offer
    scaling and root planing (aka: deep cleaning) - we work with patients closely in these cases to get them to a healthier, more stable condition that
    can be maintained.)</li>
    <li id="xray">Digital X-rays - Dental X-rays are a useful diagnostic tool when helping your dentist detect damage and disease not visible during a
    regular dental exam. Without x-rays, problem areas may go undetected.</li>
    <li id="sealants">Sealants - Sealants are plastic coatings that are applied to the chewing surfaces of permanent teeth to prevent cavities. Sealants are
    generally placed on children’s teeth.</li>
